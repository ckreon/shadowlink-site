Ever wonder what information security, data protection and online safety has to do with you?

If so, you’re not alone. These days terms like ‘breach’, ‘hacker’ and ‘online privacy’ are becoming ubiquitous. The general public usually assumes they personally don’t have anything to worry about. This may or may not be true for the average person, but for others the repercussions can be life altering.

Fortunately there are easy and simple things we can all do to avoid being the ‘low hanging fruit’.

ShadowLink would like to present our new learning resource: The OpenSourceSec Blog. 

Each week this blog will take a look at information security issues that we all need to be concerned with and give our best recommendations for multiple levels of vulnerability. The goal is to demystify information security and provide it free of charge in a way that makes it understandable and useful for all levels of technical proficiency.
