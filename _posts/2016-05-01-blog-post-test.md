Nellie is blowing them all AWAY. Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. Yo quiero leche. Yo quiero leche de madre. Hey, look at that – you're mean sober, too. I know she's a brownish area! With points! And I love her!

I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! Are you aware of this? Coming soon. Indeed. There's a girl in my soup! GENE!! [screams] Do you have any idea how often you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi.

Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw.

No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose? In prison, you just have to close your eyes and take it, but here you have to close your eyes and give it. But I did finally get into Dad's pants. Although I had to have the crotch taken in a little bit.

Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough. There's unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook. [climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun.

Te quiero. English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. In prison, you just have to close your eyes and take it, but here you have to close your eyes and give it. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. Oh…yeah…the guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! I need a fake passport, preferably to France… I like the way they think. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce.

I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Make love in your *own* hand, Mother!

Interfere? I ought to pull down your pants and spank your ass raw. Michael: I'm sorry, have we met? I'M A MONSTER!! Maybe it was the eleven months he spent in the womb. The doctor said there were claw marks on the walls of her uterus. Even though sooooo many people in this office are begging for it.

I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it? Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. No borders, no limits… go ahead, touch the Cornballer… you know best? Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully, we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on each other. Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape-horn? Or it could be your colon. I'd want to get in there and find some answers.

She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. [Stabbing Gob] White power! Gob: I'm white! What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose? Excuse me, do these effectively hide my thunder? Touché, Pandora. What, so the guy we are meeting with can't even grow his own hair? COME ON! I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch!
